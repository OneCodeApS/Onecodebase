# Major-version Postgres upgrade via dump & restore, using the stock postgres
# image (no extra tooling).
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, MANUAL STEP:
#   • The official postgres image refuses to start on a data dir created by a
#     different MAJOR (e.g. 18 binaries against a 16 data dir) — it errors and
#     exits, leaving your data untouched. So a tag bump alone won't upgrade.
#   • deploy.sh only ever recreates the dashboard (`--no-deps`), so it never
#     touches Postgres. Major upgrades are always deliberate.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   1. full cluster backup (scripts/pg-backup.sh) — the safety net,
#   2. tears down the stack and the old data volume,
#   3. initialises a fresh cluster on the NEW major and restores the backup,
#   4. brings the stack back up.
#
# The restore runs in a THROWAWAY container that does NOT mount postgres/init/*.
# The dump already contains every role, schema and row, so letting the bundled
# init scripts run too would double-seed the sample data and throw "already
# exists" errors. (A handful of harmless "role/database already exists" notices
# for the bootstrap superuser during restore are expected.)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Edit docker-compose.yml — bump `image: postgres:<NEW>-alpine`.
#   2. ./scripts/pg-major-upgrade.sh
#
# Nothing is destroyed until you type 'yes' at the confirmation prompt.
# Expect downtime for the duration (the whole stack is down while restoring).

About to upgrade Postgres ${CUR_MAJOR} → ${NEW_MAJOR}. This will:
  • stop the whole stack (downtime starts now),
  • DELETE the data volume '${VOLUME}',
  • initialise a fresh ${NEW_MAJOR} cluster and restore the backup into it,
  • bring the stack back up.

Your safety net is the backup above:
  ${BACKUP}
If anything goes wrong, you can restore it into the old image
(revert the tag in docker-compose.yml) — see DEPLOYMENT.md.
